    <h3 style="text-align: left;"> Circuity & Arduino </h3>

      <p style="text-align:left;"> This week we were tasked with completing a simple circuit on a breadboard to illuminate an LED lightbulb.
        I quickly learned the importance of resistors in tempering the amount of current that arrives at the load
        after burning through my first bulb. But, things looked up on my second go-round as I shifted the finicky wires
        into submission and the circuit worked! Pictured below is the final product. </p>

      <p style="text-align:left;"> After grappling with the breadboard, I moved onto Arduino, connecting the microcontroller to my computer's
        USB port. From there, I installed the appropriate boards and used the source code for a 'Blink' loop. I then
        compiled the code and let 'er rip! The red LED on the microcontroller blinked successfully, and I could speed up or slow down the lapse
        of time in between the pulses. Below is a video:

        <p> Working with the circuits presented a great opportunity to re-aquaint myself with electricity
        and its properties following a ~eight-year-long hiatus. This project helped me to better understand
        how electrons are ousted from the outer valence shells of conductive metals and passed from
        one atom to another to create a constant flow. Also, it was intriguing to learn how the resistor's
        value can be calculated with Ohm's law (and demonstrated with color coding) to ensure that the LED
        is kept under its maximum current rating and avoid blow-outs such as that I initially instigated. </p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;"> About Me </h3>

        <p> Now that you've read about my trials and tribulations with basic circuitry... hello! My name is Sophie,
          and I'm a junior in historic Kirkland House, home of Facebook and more than a few cuddly cockroaches.
          I am a concentrator in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB for short) and hope to earn a secondary in
          Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS), which is a longwinded way of saying that I really enjoy studying plants. </p>

        <p>  Outside of classes, I love to sing jazz music with the Radcliffe Pitches (an a cappella group) and write
          and edit for <em>Satire V</em>, the campus comedy publication. I've had the joys of playing on the ultimate frisbee team and working on quite a few theatrical productions here, my favorite
          of which was an original musical my freshman year. I also work at the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, where I help in shaping
          undergraduate curricula and, on the side, hone my nascent Photoshop skills. I am overjoyed to be taking <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/index.html"> PHYSCI-70</a>, and I hope
        you enjoy following along my creative journey on this webpage! </p>

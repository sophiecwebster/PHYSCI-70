    <p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Now that you've read about my trials and tribulations with circuitry and laser cutting... hello! My name is Sophie,
      and I'm a junior in historic Kirkland House, home of Facebook and more than a few cuddly cockroaches.
      I am a concentrator in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB for short) and hope to earn a secondary in
      Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS), which is a longwinded way of saying that I really enjoy studying plants.
      I'm also working toward a citation in Spanish. </p>

    <p style="margin-right: 20px;">  Outside of classes, I love to sing jazz music with the <a href="https://pitches.org"> Radcliffe Pitches </a>(an a cappella group) and write
      and edit for <em>Satire V</em>, a comedy publication on campus. I've had the joys of playing on the ultimate frisbee team and working on quite a few theatrical productions here, my favorite
      of which was an original musical my freshman year. I also work at the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, where I help in shaping
      undergraduate curricula and, on the side, hone my nascent Photoshop skills. I am overjoyed to be taking <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/index.html"> PHYSCI-70</a>, and I hope
    you enjoy following along my creative journey on this webpage! </p>

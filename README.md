# Documentation for PHYSCI-70: Introduction to Digital Fabrication

My [personal website](https://sophiecwebster.github.io/PHYSCI-70/) documenting weekly progress learning the ropes of digital fabrication.

For my final project, I made a real-time [vocal tuner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWROGphEhic) (entitled "Truth Hertz") with the Adafruit ESP32 Feather and a Sparkfun microphone.

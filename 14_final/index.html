      <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"> <u>Initial Proposal</u></h4>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;"> In my first pass at drafting a proposal, I am
        particularly inspired by the <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.13/people/Jonathan_Grinham/index.html">'Moss Pad'</a> created by Jonathan Grinham, as a lover of plants myself. However, instead of a computer
        mouse, I think it would be fun to create a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) pad controller that uses this biomaterial
        to a similarly soothing (well, at least to me) tacticle effect. Different segments, ideally of different varieties of moss, will have musical samples loaded into them via microcontroller, and when their FSRs are struck, they can be combined to mix beats and/or short tracks.
        The moss samples would sit in a sectioned trough that will make use
        of 3D printing. I envision this as a sort of musical garden and would probably christen it "BryoBeats," as mosses, alongside liverworts and hornworts, belong to a stalwart group of early land plants called 'byrophytes' (my work ethos is "Pun Before Project").

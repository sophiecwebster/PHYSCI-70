    <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;"> <u>DIY Capacitive Sensor!</u> </h4>

      <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"> This week's project centered around understanding
        the function and design of input sensors, with a special focus on capacitive (a word that I endlessly struggle to spell) sensing. While we were shown a variety of
        sensors in class that measured tilt, angle, volume, and force, I thought that I might make my sensor have a fun musical output as well as measuring input (perhaps straying off the beaten path slightly).
        I decided that a pseudo-MIDI keyboard would be the ideal project to explore making my own capacitive sensors (the keys), while applying another sensor (a potentiometer) to change volume of the output.
      </p>

    <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: 16px;"> To begin, I wanted to test the waters and see if I could send create a capacitive sensor, using the touch of my finger as 'ground' (as we explored in class) and
    assigned a tone, measured in frequency in hertz, to the pin that had the conductor attached to it. This resulted in a pitch (in this case, a C3) played when I touched the capacitor. I used a Piezo buzzer (which plays sound and has the ability to modulate tone)
    to project the pitch. This rudimentary example is visible in the video and image at the right. </p>


      <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 60px; font-size: 16px;">
        After scanning the Ganesh statuette and figuring out the transfer process from polygon mesh to the slicer's g-code to the Prusa printer by way of SD card, I looked forward to doing some work
        in Fusion 360 to design an object to print. After some brainstorming, I thought it might be fun to explore topography and  elevation in the natural world and model it in three dimensions. I found
        this amazing website called <a href="http://jthatch.com/Terrain2STL/"> Terrain2STL</a>, into which you put your coordinates of choice and select the size of the area of interest. Users can even
        manually lower sea level to emphasize and enhance height differentials. I tried a series of locales, but I found that the Himalayas worked particulary well, for pretty obvious reasons in that I could not zoom in
        all that far with Terrain2STL.

    <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: 16px;">
      I brought this STL into Fusion, where I redefined it as a body and made an appropriately-sized base for the topography to be displayed on. I sent this off to the
        Prusa Slicer and then to printer. After in first go-round, I saw that the printer had stopped working, reporting an error of "Thermal Runaway". None too auspicious! I tried turning the fan off
        on my next iteration (per Victoria's counsel), but this threw the same error at the same point on the second layer. I tried once more on a different printer, and it still didn't work. So, I went back into Slicer
        and changed the printing settings to ensure it the fan was not running 100% the entire time. Sure enough, that worked! This print job took about 2 hours.

    <h4 style="margin-left: 20px;"> <u>The Regal Rena Bust</u> </h4>

    <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: 16px;">
      After letting the mountain run its course, I came back to the Fab Lab accompanied by my friend Rena to pick it up. When I showed her around, she was particularly excited by the scanner, so, naturally, I offered to scan her head.
      (Many snaps to her for her enthusiasm and good-sportedness). In class, we found that many folks had difficulty getting their subjects' hair to show up due to its reflectivity. So, we were surprised to observe that Rena's curls were captured
      up extremely well by the scan.

      <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px;"> I patched over some holes and solidified the design so it would look more like a bust.
      Then, I began the process of slicing and dicing the file to transform it from an STL to g-code. Then I sent it off to the printer; we decided on an ambitious height of 7 cm
      and left it to run overnight for approximately 6.5 hours. After cleaning and sanding it, I am happy to report Rena is very pleased with the final product! </p>

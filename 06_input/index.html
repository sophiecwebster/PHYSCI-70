    <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px;"> <u>DIY Capacitive Sensor!</u> </h4>

      <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;"> This week's project centered around understanding
        the function and design of input sensors, with a special focus on capacitive (a word that I endlessly struggle to spell) sensing. While we were shown a variety of
        sensors in class that measured tilt, angle, volume, and force, I thought that I might make my sensor have a fun musical output as well as measuring input (perhaps straying off the beaten path slightly).
        I decided that a pseudo-MIDI keyboard would be the ideal project to explore making my own capacitive sensors (the keys), while applying another sensor (a potentiometer) to change volume of the output.

    <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: 16px;"> To begin, I wanted to test the waters and see if I could send create a capacitive sensor, using the touch of my finger as 'ground' (as we explored in class) and
    assigned a tone, measured in frequency in hertz, to the pin that had the conductor attached to it. This resulted in a pitch (in this case, a C3) played when I touched the capacitor. I used a Piezo buzzer (which plays sound and has the ability to modulate tone)
    to project the pitch. This rudimentary example is visible in the video and image at the right. </p>


      <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 60px; font-size: 16px;">
        With this proof of concept in hand, I moved onto adding more keys to the mix, assigning different pins different frequencies that would eventually correspond to a C-Major scale. I used a nifty
        helper file called pitches.h, which listed the frequency of each note on a piano and assigned them comprehensible variable names.

    <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: 16px;">
      My next bottleneck was the layout of my board; I realized that, by assigning each capacitor a unique digital input and output pin, I had maxed out the number of digital pins
      available to me with only 5 notes, which does not a full C-major chord make! So, I needed to rethink and streamline my design. Fortunately, harnessing the conductive powers of the breadboard, I
      was able to assign every piece of copper tape a unique output pin but a common input pin (Pin 2). This allowed for my design to accomodate all eight notes I was hoping it would
      (in an ideal world, I'd have accidentals, meaning 13 notes total), but I would likely need a multiplexer to get that job done. However, this ended up working just fine!

    <p style="text-align:left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px; font-size: 16px;">
      After letting the mountain run its course, I came back to the Fab Lab accompanied by my friend Rena to pick it up. When I showed her around, she was particularly excited by the scanner, so, naturally, I offered to scan her head.
      (Many snaps to her for her enthusiasm and good-sportedness). In class, we found that many folks had difficulty getting their subjects' hair to show up due to its reflectivity. So, we were surprised to observe that Rena's curls were captured
      up extremely well by the scan.

      <p style="text-align:left; margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 20px;"> I patched over some holes and solidified the design so it would look more like a bust.
      Then, I began the process of slicing and dicing the file to transform it from an STL to g-code. Then I sent it off to the printer; we decided on an ambitious height of 7 cm
      and left it to run overnight for approximately 6.5 hours. After cleaning and sanding it, I am happy to report Rena is very pleased with the final product! </p>
